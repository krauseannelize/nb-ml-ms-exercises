# Machine Learning Notes | Masterschool Exercise

## About This Repo

This is my personal Machine Learning learning journal from the Masterschool Data Analytics program.

## Sprint 1: Intro to Machine Learning & Data Preparation

Get your hands dirty: clean data, build your very first model, and see it make predictions.

## Sprint 2: Supervised Machine Learning

Go deeper: test how good your model really is and unlock the world of regression.

## Sprint 3: Supervised Learning Project

Put your skills to work—build a real classification project from start to finish.

## Sprint 4: Unsupervised Machine Learning

Discover hidden patterns—explore clustering, anomaly detection, and wrap up with a final project.
